Elisa is a music player developed by the KDE community that strives to be
simple and nice to use. We also recognize that we need a flexible product
to account for the different workflows and use-cases of our users.

We focus on a very good integration with the Plasma desktop of the KDE
community without compromising the support for other platforms (other
Linux desktop environments, Windows and Android).

The music is indexed using either a private indexer or an indexer using
Baloo.

The private one can be configured to scan music on chosen paths.
The Baloo one is much faster because Baloo is providing all needed data
from its own database.

You can build and play your own playlist.
