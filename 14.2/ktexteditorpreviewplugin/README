KTextEditor Document Preview Plugin

A plugin for the editor Kate, the IDE KDevelop, or other software
using the KTextEditor framework.

This plugin enables a live preview of the currently edited text
document in the final format.

For the display it uses the KParts plugin which is currently
selected as the preferred one for the MIME type of the document.
If there is no matching KParts plugin, no preview is possible.
