Kcollectd (simple collectd graphing front-end for KDE)

kcollectd is a graphical front-end to collectd, a data collection service
that monitors, by polling or pushed updates, system information, such as
temperature or free RAM.

kcollectd directly displays the data, which is stored in an round-robin
database. It is quite limited as it only displays one datasource at a
time, but allows to zoom and scroll around. It also has a status-monitor
mode, where it automatic updates every 10 seconds.
