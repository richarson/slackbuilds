git-cola is a Python-powered GPL licensed GUI for git.

The website says:

"NOTE: We do not yet recommend using PyQt5 because there are known
exit-on-segfault bugs in Qt5 that have not yet been addressed. git-cola
is sensitive to this bug and is known to crash on exit when using git dag
or the interactive rebase feature on PyQt5.

QTBUG-52988 (https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-52988)

PyQt4 is stable and there are no known issues when using it so we
recommend using PyQt4 until the Qt5 bugs have been resolved.

Set QT_API=pyqt4 in your environment if you have both versions of PyQt
installed and want to ensure that PyQt4 is used.

NOTE: git-cola includes a vendored copy of its QtPy dependency."

That said, if you set QT_API=pyqt4 git-cola segfaults, but it works fine
with Qt5 and PyQt5 from AlienBOB's repository.
