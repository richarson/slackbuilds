grepcidr can be used to filter a list of IP addresses against one or more
Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) specifications.

As with grep, there are options to invert matching and load patterns from
a file. grepcidr is capable of efficiently processing large numbers of
IPs and networks.

grepcidr has endless uses in network software, including: mail filtering and
processing, network security, log analysis, and many custom applications.

For detailed instructions and examples, please see the README file or man
page. A couple examples of usage:

    grepcidr 2001:db8::/32 logfile
    grepcidr 66.249.64.0/19 access.log
